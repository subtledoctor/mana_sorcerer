# mana_sorcerer
Points-based sorcerer casting for BGEE et al.

More Readme to come.  For now:
- It learns spells like a sorcerer...
- and it casts like a sorcerer...
- except via points, instead of spell slots constrained by level.
- Install immediately after Tome & Blood.
- Cannot cast Identify, unless you install TnB "Revised Identify" or "Level 1 Cantrips."
- Cannot use Sequencers, unless you install option 5 of TnB "Innate Sequencers."
- With v0.6, added 'Restorative Meditation' ability to regenerate some mana points
