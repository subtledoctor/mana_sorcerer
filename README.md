# mana_sorcerer
Points-based sorcerer casting for BGEE et al.

More Readme to come.  For now:
- It's a *Mage* kit...
- but it learns spells like a sorcerer...
- and it casts like a sorcerer...
- except via points, instead of spell slots constrained by level.
- Cannot cast Identify.
- Cannot use Sequencers, unless installed after option 5 of TnB "Innate Sequencers."
- Install immediately after Tome & Blood.
